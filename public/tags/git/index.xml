      <description>Yesterday marked my four months membership of GitHub. Back then, I had seen many GitHub repos pass by after joining Twitter a few weeks earlier, and I wanted to star some of them to find them back more easily. It took another 23 days before I actually committed something myself.
Now, four months later, I use GitHub (private) and GitLab (work) as good as daily, and I have inspired others to start using it.</description>
